# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This repository is a fork of Krish Naik’s The Grand Complete Data Science Materials.
I have added a new project under the ML Projects folder called Heart Disease Prediction.

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a person has heart disease based on medical data.

📌 What’s included in the project?

Jupyter Notebook

Data preprocessing

Model training (Logistic Regression / Random Forest)

Model evaluation

Final prediction results

🎯 Purpose of this contribution

I added this project to share a simple and easy-to-understand machine learning example for beginners and students learning data science
